# PyLuaSympy
## Introduction
PyLuaSympy is the python companion module to the LuaTeX LuaSympy package. Equations and variables 
defined using the PyLuaSympy are accessible and usable to the typical python computations that would
be carried out, but have the added bonus of being easily incorporated into a LaTeX document at a
later time.

## Warning
This code is currently in early stages and experimental it has only been tested on a Linux system
but should work on any Unix based system or a Windows system. Behaviours may still change.

## Requirements
PyLuaSympy relies on the following packages to provide its functionality:
```
numpy
sympy
```
Installing via pip however should resolve any dependency issues and install any missing packages.

## Installation
Installation is done by cloning this github repo and installing using 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/humdrumcomet/pyluasympy
$ cd lunatexPython
$ pip install -U -e ./
```
